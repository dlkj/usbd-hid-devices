Batteries included embedded USB HID library for [`usb-device`](https://crates.io/crates/usb-device).
Includes concrete Keyboard (boot and NKRO), Mouse and Consumer Control implementations as well as
support for building your own HID classes.

This library has been tested on the RP2040 but should work on any platform supported by
[`usb-device`](https://crates.io/crates/usb-device).

Devices created with this library should work with any USB host. It has been tested on Windows,
Linux, MacOS and Android.

**Note:** Managed interfaces that support HID idle, such as
[`NKROBootKeyboardInterface`](https://docs.rs/usbd-human-interface-device/latest/usbd_human_interface_device/device/keyboard/struct.NKROBootKeyboardInterface.html)
and [`BootKeyboardInterface`](https://docs.rs/usbd-human-interface-device/latest/usbd_human_interface_device/device/keyboard/struct.BootKeyboardInterface.html),
require their `tick()` method calling every 1ms/at 1kHz.

```rust,no_run
use usbd_human_interface_device::page::Keyboard;
use usbd_human_interface_device::device::keyboard::{KeyboardLedsReport, NKROBootKeyboardInterface};
use usbd_human_interface_device::prelude::*;

let usb_alloc = UsbBusAllocator::new(usb_bus);

let mut keyboard = UsbHidClassBuilder::new()
    .add_interface(
        NKROBootKeyboardInterface::default_config(),
    )
    .build(&usb_alloc);

let mut usb_dev = UsbDeviceBuilder::new(&usb_alloc, UsbVidPid(0x1209, 0x0001))
    .manufacturer("usbd-human-interface-device")
    .product("NKRO Keyboard")
    .serial_number("TEST")
    .build();

let mut tick_timer = timer.count_down();
tick_timer.start(1.millis());

loop {
    let keys = if pin.is_high().unwrap() {
            &[Keyboard::A]
        } else {
            &[Keyboard::NoEventIndicated]
    };
    
    keyboard.interface().write_report(keys).ok();

    //tick once per ms/at 1kHz
    if tick_timer.wait().is_ok() {
        keyboard.interface().tick().unwrap();
    }
    
    if usb_dev.poll(&mut [&mut keyboard]) {
        match keyboard.interface().read_report() {

            Ok(l) => {
                update_leds(l);
            }
            _ => {}

        }
    }
}
```
